# 🧪 Monte Carlo Optimization Report (50-Year Horizon)

## Goal
Maximize the likelihood of portfolio survival for a **50-Year Horizon** (e.g., Early Retirement at 40 to age 90).
- **Corpus**: ₹4.5 Cr
- **Expense**: ₹12 Lakh/yr (growing at 7% inflation)
- **Challenge**: 7% inflation over 50 years makes expenses explode (30x increase).

## 🏆 Top Configurations (Max Survival Probability)

| Rank | Allocation (B1/B2/B3) | Tactical Buffer | Success Rate (50y) | Median Ending Wealth | worst 10% (Survival) |
|------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | **5% / 20% / 75%**    | **2 Years**     | **79%**            | ₹ 73.86 Cr           | 33 Years             |
| 2    | **5% / 20% / 75%**    | **3 Years**     | **78%**            | ₹ 77.28 Cr           | 40 Years             |
| 3    | **10% / 20% / 70%**   | **2 Years**     | **77%**            | ₹ 73.90 Cr           | 39 Years             |
| 4    | **5% / 30% / 65%**    | **2 Years**     | **72%**            | ₹ 58.36 Cr           | 39 Years             |
| 5    | **5% / 10% / 85%**    | **2 Years**     | **71%**            | ₹ 66.24 Cr           | 38 Years             |

## 🔍 Key Findings for 50 Years
1.  **Equity is Non-Negotiable**: To survive 50 years of 7% inflation, you **need >65% Equity (Bucket 3)**.
    *   Configs with <50% Equity failed almost 100% of the time (ran out of money by Year 35-40).
    *   The "Safe" 10/40/50 allocation only had a ~40-50% success rate.

2.  **Leaner Cash Buffer**: The **2-Year Buffer** consistently beat the 5-Year Buffer.
    *   Holding 5 years of cash for 50 years creates massive "Cash Drag".
    *   A 2-Year buffer is risky in the short term but essential for long-term survival.

3.  **The "Safety" Paradox**:
    *   Traditional "Safe" portfolios (more Cash/Income) are **High Risk** for 50-year periods because they cannot keep up with inflation.
    *   "Aggressive" portfolios (75% Equity) are actually **Safer** because they generate the returns needed to survive.

## ✅ Recommendation
For a 50-year horizon with 7% inflation:
- **Allocation**: **5% Cash / 20% Income / 75% Growth**
- **Tactical Buffer**: **2 or 3 Years**
- **Note**: This is volatile! You will see big swings, but it's the only mathematically viable way to safeguard against 50 years of inflation.
