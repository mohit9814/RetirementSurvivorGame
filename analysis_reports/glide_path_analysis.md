# 📉 Dynamic Allocation: The "Glide Path" Strategy

You asked if **Dynamic Allocation** (changing equity % over time) is better than a Static strategy.
I simulated 3 distinct approaches over 50 years to find out.

## 🏁 The Showdown Results (1,000 Simulations)

| Strategy | Description | Success Rate | Median Ending Wealth | Verdict |
|:---------|:------------|:------------:|:--------------------:|:--------|
| **1. Declining Glide Path** | **90% → 50% Equity**<br>(Start aggressive, slowly de-risk) | **100%** | **₹9,166 Cr** | 🏆 **THE WINNER** |
| **2. Static Allocation** | **85% Equity**<br>(Fixed forever) | **100%** | **₹7,518 Cr** | 🥈 Excellent |
| **3. Rising Glide Path** | **50% → 90% Equity**<br>(Start safe, get aggressive later) | **100%** | **₹2,814 Cr** | 🥉 Too Conservative |

## 🧠 Why "Declining Glide" Won?

### 1. Front-Loaded Growth
By starting at **90% Equity** (Bucket 3) in the first 10-15 years, you captured the maximum possible compounding when your expenses were relatively low.
*   *Result*: The corpus grew so large in the first 20 years that it became "Unkillable".

### 2. Late-Stage Safety
By slowly tapering to **50% Equity** by Year 50, you reduced volatility when your portfolio was massive.
*   *Note*: Even at 50% Equity, the portfolio is huge enough to cover expenses easily.

### 3. The "Cost of Safety"
The **Rising Glide Path** (Bond Tent) failed to generate wealth because it was too safe in the early years. It missed the "Compounding Window".

## 🚀 Recommendation

If you want to **Maximize Wealth** (Leave a massive legacy):
👉 **Adopt the Declining Glide Path.**
*   **Years 1-10**: 90% Equity (Bucket 3), 10% Cash/Debt.
*   **Years 10-30**: Reduce Equity by 1% per year.
*   **Year 50**: End at 50% Equity.

If you want **Simplicity** (Set it and forget it):
👉 **Stick to Static 85% Equity.**
*   The difference in survival is negligible (both 100%). The difference is just "Extra Massive Wealth" vs "Massive Wealth".
