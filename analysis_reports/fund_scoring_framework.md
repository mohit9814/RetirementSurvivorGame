# 🎯 The "Survivor" Fund Scoring Framework

To ensure your portfolio survives 50 years, we don't just pick "highest return". We pick **Durability**.
Here is the 4-Factor Scoring Model you can use to evaluate any fund.

## The 4-Factor Rubric (Total Score: 100)

### 1. Consistency (Weight: 40%)
*Does the fund beat its category average consistently over rolling periods?*
- **Criteria**: Look at **5-Year Rolling Returns**.
- **Scoring**:
    - Beats Category Avg > 80% of time: **40/40**
    - Beats Category Avg > 60% of time: **30/40**
    - Beats Category Avg > 50% of time: **20/40**
    - Below Average: **0/40**

### 2. Protection (Weight: 30%)
*How much does it lose when the market crashes?*
- **Criteria**: **Max Drawdown** and Downside Capture.
- **Scoring**:
    - Drawdown is 5%+ *less* than peers (e.g. Fund -30% vs Category -35%): **30/30**
    - Drawdown is equal to peers: **20/30**
    - Drawdown is worse than peers: **0/30**

### 3. Risk Efficiency (Weight: 20%)
*How much return are you getting for every unit of risk?*
- **Criteria**: **Sharpe Ratio**.
- **Scoring**:
    - Sharpe > 0.8: **20/20**
    - Sharpe 0.5 - 0.8: **10/20**
    - Sharpe < 0.5: **0/20**

### 4. Longevity (Weight: 10%)
*Has the fund survived multiple cycles?*
- **Criteria**: **Fund Age**.
- **Scoring**:
    - Age > 10 Years: **10/10**
    - Age < 10 Years: **0/10** (We need veterans for a 50y simulation)
