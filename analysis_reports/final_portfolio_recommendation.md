# 🏗️ Final Portfolio Composition (The "Post-PPFAS" Strategy)

Removing Parag Parikh Flexi Cap (due to the "Foreign Equity Anomaly") forces us to look for domestic consistency. The data points to a clear winner in the "Core Equity" space that survived 10+ years of cycles.

## 🎯 The New strategy

### Bucket 3: The Growth Engine (Target: 18% CAGR)
Without Parag Parikh, we split the core between a **Large & Mid Cap** anchor and a **Mid/Small Cap** booster.

| Role | Fund | Weight | Why? |
|:-----|:-----|:------:|:-----|
| **Anchor (Core)** | **Canara Robeco Large & Mid Cap** | **40%** | **The Stabilizer.** 18.9% Rolling Return. Replaces the "Flexi Cap" role with high-quality large/mid stocks. |
| **Growth (Aggressive)** | **HDFC Mid Cap Opportunities** | **40%** | **The Compounder.** 19.4% Rolling Return. A 18-year veteran that proves size hasn't killed performance. |
| **Alpha (Kicker)** | **SBI Small Cap** | **20%** | **The Booster.** 20% Rolling Return. Consistent alpha generator with managed volatility. |

*   **Weighted Avg Return**: ~19.3%
*   **Weighted Avg Volatility**: ~15.5%

### Bucket 2: The Income Engine (Target: 10-12% CAGR)
We need steady returns to fight 7% inflation.

| Role | Fund | Weight | Why? |
|:-----|:-----|:------:|:-----|
| **Defense** | **Parag Parikh Conservative Hybrid** | **50%** | **The Rock.** 9.3% Return / 2.9% Volatility. (Debt-like safety). |
| **Offense** | **Franklin India Balanced Advantage** | **50%** | **The Yield.** 12.5% Return / 6.0% Volatility. (Tax-efficient growth). |

*   **Weighted Avg Return**: ~10.9%
*   **Weighted Avg Volatility**: ~4.5%

## 📊 Summary of Allocation

| Bucket | Allocation | Expected Return | Volatility | Survival Impact |
|:-------|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------|
| **Bucket 1 (Cash)** | 5-10% | 7.0% | <1% | Immediate Expenses (0-3 Years) |
| **Bucket 2 (Income)** | 30-40% | 11.0% | ~4-5% | Inflation Hedge (4-10 Years) |
| **Bucket 3 (Growth)** | 50-60% | 19.3% | ~15% | Wealth Multiplier (10-50 Years) |

### 🚀 Why this works?
By replacing the "Foreign Equity Luck" of PPFAS with **HDFC Mid Cap** + **Canara Robeco**, you are betting on the **India Growth Story** (Domestic Demand, Infra, Banking) which is the structural theme for the next 20 years.
